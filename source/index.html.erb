                    Having graduated from Florida State with degrees in Computer
                    Science and Music Composition, my interests range from 
                    writing novels to writing computer programs, and from 
                    singing in church to playing in a local rock band. I love 
                    beaches, mountains, surfing and hiking... and writing about 
                    them. I'd love to find a way to put my talents to work for
                    you!

                    What's more dangerous: asteroids and space aliens, or swirlies and high school punks? Join Matt, an up-and-coming graphic artist, as he navigates the bizarre universe of his freshman year while relating in his sketchbook just how much high school feels like a bizarre space prison in which there are no rules, no order, and no friends.

                  When your car breaks down on the drive home for Christmas, do you: 
                      call your pilot friend and have him fly you home, 
                      learn that "FORD" stands for "found on roadside dead,"
                      call a AAA towtruck, or
                      "all of the above?"
