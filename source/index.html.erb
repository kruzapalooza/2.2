                    What's more dangerous: asteroids and space aliens, or swirlies and
                    high school punks? Join Matt, an up-and-coming graphic artist, as
                    he navigates the bizarre universe of his freshman year. In his sketchbook,

                    bizarre space prison where chaos rules and friends are fleeting.
