                    Ryan let me fly almost an hour. &#8220Don't chase the instruments or the GPS reading. You'll overcorrect constantly,&#8221 he repeated many times. &#8220Is the whole flight going to roll like this with you overcorrecting? The passengers are getting sick.&#8221 "Chasing the instruments" means looking down at needles and readings more than straight ahead where you're actually going. It's a little less obnoxious and dangerous than texting while driving, but not much. For the sake of said imaginary passengers, I picked a lake on the horizon, flew toward it, and barely looked at the instruments. Countless lakes and forests all slowly rolled under the plane 4,500 feet below us. I flew more smoothly, and Ryan's impromptu flight coaching instantly became less sarcastic.

                    Ryan pointed out John Travolta's house near Ocala, in a neighborhood with a unique Home Owner's Association rule: Every resident had to own a plane. Nearly a mile up, things looked much smaller and the plane seemed to crawl like a tortoise. But our ground speed was 80 miles per hour. Far to the south, I saw buildings I thought might be a small town on a small lake, but quickly realized it was Downtown Tampa's skyline. 
                    Near Crystal River, Ryan took the the wheel, and I switched to full tour guide mode. I pointed out the infamous Crystal River Nuclear Power Plant, four years inactive. Some so-called routine maintenance had weakened the concrete enough to put it at risk for becoming the next Chernobyl. I pointed out Weeki Wachee Springs, home of a locally famous mermaid show. Starting around New Port Richey, we followed the coast south toward Clearwater. A water color painting stretched out below us with blue background of water, green strips of barrier islands, and many white dots of atolls in the Intracoastal Waterway. I recognized these islands as Dunedin Beach, Caledesi Island and Clearwater Beach.

                    As we turned to the south-southeast, I spotted the Clearwater Executive Airpark landing, only two miles from where I grew up. Small planes flew over my parent's house frequently, and recently our neighbor grumbled about the noise. She wondered why the same plane kept flying the same stupid path over our houses like a barnstormer. I knew now the &#8220stupid path&#8221 was called a &#8220touch-and-go,&#8221 a take-off-and-land flight drill flown in the shape of a huge oval high school track. I'm sure our neighbor would be thrilled to know my best friend's hobby contributed to disturbing her afternoon naps. 
                    As we touched town, I realized how small the airpark was. My parents greeted us in the airpark's double-wide trailer terminal. I had always wanted to take off and land here as a kid, and now, at 34 years old, my childhood wish came true two days before Christmas.
